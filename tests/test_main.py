"""
A collection of some basic tests for the Arduino library.

Extensive coverage is a bit difficult, since a positive test involves actually
connecting and issuing commands to a live Arduino, hosting any hardware
required to test a particular function. But a core of basic communication tests
should at least be maintained here.
